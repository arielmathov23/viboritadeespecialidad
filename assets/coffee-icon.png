This is a placeholder for the coffee-icon.png file.

Since we can't directly create a binary PNG file through code editing, there are two options:
1. Use the SVG file (coffee-icon.svg) we created, which p5.js can load directly
2. Manually add a PNG coffee icon image file to the assets folder

For now, we can modify the sketch.js file to load the SVG version instead of PNG.
